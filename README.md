# prophecy-build-tool

**Prophecy** is designed to enable all users to be productive with data engineering. It also replaces legacy ETL
products.
To learn more about Prophecy visit https://docs.prophecy.io/.

**Prophecy-built-tool** (PBT) allows you to quickly build projects generated by Prophecy (your standard Spark Scala and
PySpark pipelines) to integrate them with your own CI / CD (e.g. Github Actions), build system (e.g. Jenkins), and
orchestration (e.g. Databricks Workflows).

## Installation

To install PBT, simply run:

```shell
pip3 install prophecy-build-tool
```

## Running

To build and deploy your Prophecy project containing Python projects and Databricks Jobs run

```shell
pbt deploy --path /path/to/your/prophecy_project/
```
